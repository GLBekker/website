    <p><strong>Project Commencement Information:</strong> Upon acceptance of a quotation, the Client agrees to provide all necessary project information and content within 14 days. If delays are anticipated, the Client must notify Virtual Life Solutions (PTY) Ltd in writing (email preferred). Failure to provide the required information within the specified period may result in adjusted timelines and/or a project delay fee.</p>
    <p><strong>Out of Scope Work:</strong> Any requests for additional features or modifications beyond the agreed scope will be evaluated and quoted separately. Work will commence only upon written approval and any additional deposit required.</p>
    <p><strong>Post-Development Review Period:</strong> After development, the Client will have 14 days to review deliverables. Revisions within scope will be addressed at no extra cost; changes beyond this period are subject to additional charges.</p>
    <p><strong>Quotation and Effort Estimation Adjustments:</strong> Quotations are based on initial project specifications and estimated effort. They are valid for 14 days, and any significant post-quotation changes may require a revised quotation.</p>

    <h2>Pricing and Project Estimates</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Project-Based Quotations:</strong> Virtual Life Solutions (PTY) Ltd provides project fees based on detailed quotations tailored to each Client's specific project requirements and proposed solutions. Fixed hourly rates are not listed within these Terms and Conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>Quotations as Estimates:</strong> Quotations provided by Virtual Life Solutions (PTY) Ltd are estimates based on our understanding of the project scope, complexity, and anticipated effort at the time of quotation. While we strive to provide accurate estimates, they are not fixed or guaranteed prices. The final cost of the project will be based on the actual time and resources expended to complete the agreed-upon scope of work.</li>
      <li><strong>Effort-Based Estimation:</strong> Quotations will outline the estimated effort required for the proposed solution. This estimate is based on our professional assessment of the project requirements and is intended to provide the Client with a reasonable expectation of the project's scope and potential cost.</li>
      <li><strong>Bucket Hours System:</strong> For certain projects, Virtual Life Solutions (PTY) Ltd may utilize a "bucket hours" system. This involves pre-purchasing blocks of project hours ("bucket hours") allocated to specific project phases or milestones (e.g., Proof of Concept, Phase 1 Development, etc.).</li>
      <li><strong>Pre-Invoiced Bucket Hours:</strong> Bucket hours will be invoiced in advance of each project phase or milestone. Work on a phase will commence upon receipt of payment for the corresponding bucket hours invoice.</li>
      <li><strong>Monitoring and Notification:</strong> Virtual Life Solutions (PTY) Ltd will monitor the usage of bucket hours throughout each project phase. When a bucket of hours is nearing depletion, we will notify the Client to discuss project progress and remaining tasks.</li>
      <li><strong>Client Options Upon Bucket Depletion:</strong> Upon depletion of a purchased bucket of hours, the Client will have the following options:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Purchase Additional Bucket Hours:</strong> The Client may choose to purchase an additional bucket of hours to continue with the project. A quotation for the additional bucket hours will be provided based on the estimated effort required to complete the remaining scope.</li>
          <li><strong>Project Review and Scope Adjustment:</strong> The Client may request a review of the project scope to determine if adjustments can be made to complete the project within the initially estimated budget or with a revised scope of work and potentially adjusted bucket hours.</li>
          <li><strong>Project Termination:</strong> The Client may choose to terminate the project. In this case, the Client will be invoiced for the bucket hours purchased up to that point, and no refunds will be provided for unused hours within a purchased bucket. Any completed work up to the point of termination will be delivered as per the agreement.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Final Invoice Based on Actual Time:</strong> Regardless of the bucket hours system, the final invoice for the project will reflect the actual time spent and resources utilized by Virtual Life Solutions (PTY) Ltd in delivering the agreed-upon scope of work. This may align with the pre-purchased bucket hours or may require adjustments based on actual project execution.</li>
      <li><strong>Out of Scope Work and Re-Estimation:</strong> Any changes to the project scope or requests for features or functionalities beyond the original quotation will be considered Out of Scope Work (as described in the "Development Work and Payment" section). Such changes will require a re-evaluation of the estimated effort and may result in a revised quotation and adjustment to the bucket hours required to complete the project.</li>
      <li><strong>Deposit Requirement:</strong> The deposit requirement as outlined in the "Development Work and Payment" section of these Terms and Conditions remains applicable to all projects, regardless of the pricing model.</li>
