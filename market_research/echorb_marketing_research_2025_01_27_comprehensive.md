## 6. Pricing Strategy Validation

### Competitive Analysis
- **Echorb:** $10/month (proposed)
- **Cursor:** $20/month
- **Windsurf:** $15/month
- **Copilot Pro:** $10/month (but different value prop)

### Value Justification

- Lower than all direct competitors
- Risk: AI model costs may force price increases industry-wide

### Pricing Recommendations
1. **Launch Price:** Stick with $10/month
2. **Early Bird:** $8/month for first 100 users (lifetime)
3. **Annual Discount:** $96/year (20% off)
4. **Team Pricing:** Consider $8/user/month for 5+ seats
5. **Usage-Based Alternative:** Consider credits system for heavy users
